# Physics-Simulations-with-MATLAB

This project showcases various numerical methods implemented in MATLAB to simulate complex physical systems, including double pendulums, mass-spring systems, and partial differential equations. The aim is to provide a comprehensive collection of scripts and visualizations that demonstrate the application of different numerical techniques to solve and analyze these systems.

This project aims to explore and simulate various physical phenomena using numerical methods. The simulations include:

- **3D Projectile Motion** with different resistance models.
- **Double Pendulum Dynamics** using Euler, Runge-Kutta, and Verlet integration methods.
- **Mass-Spring System** simulations with different numerical integration techniques.
- **Non-linear Pendulum** and its behavior under various conditions.
- **Diffusion Equations** with logistic terms and convective effects.
- **Time-Dependent SchrÃ¶dinger Equation** for quantum mechanics simulations.
- **Wilberforce Pendulum**
- **Burgers Equation**
 
$i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 + k x^4 \right) \psi $


$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} + r C \left(1 - \frac{C}{K}\right)$


$L = \frac{1}{2} m (\dot{x}_1^2 + \dot{x}_2^2 + \dot{x}_3^2) - \frac{1}{2} k x_1^2 - \frac{1}{2} k (x_2 - x_1)^2 - \frac{1}{2} k (x_3 - x_2)^2 - \frac{1}{2} k x_3^2$


\begin{align}
m \ddot{x}_1 &= -kx_1 + k(x_2 - x_1) \\
m \ddot{x}_2 &= -k(x_2 - x_1) + k(x_3 - x_2) \\
m \ddot{x}_3 &= -kx_3 - k(x_3 - x_2)
\end{align}
